# Drones-Manager
Application for deliveries using drones.

It's possible to select the destination using Google maps and load the drones with the products in the catalogue. Drones are automatically loaded until their fullfillment. After this an order summary it's shown and, if confirmed, the drones are associated with a pilot and a technician. All the resources are synchronized in order to have the best deliver time and as much deliveries as possible.
